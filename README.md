### Stage - 1
- Peer (Node)
	- A Peer is a unanimous node, which is independently in itself both client and server.
	- A Peer does not need to be dependent some central system to function.
	- All the peers in this system will be bound to localhost with different port numbers.

	- TODO: Try if you can convert your mobile phone into a peer.

	###### Implementation
	- For now I will implement peer's as just sockets which are bound to different ports on the 
	same machine.
